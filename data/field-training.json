The entire goal here is to explore as many slots as possible on the clock, lessening the pull of the stable attractor state arm slot that he's currently been throwing out of.\n\nThen we constrain him to way down low by starting the ball as close to the ground as possible and providing an external target, requiring him to find that lower slot to achieve the task.\n\nTask specific constraints ain't the only piece of the puzzle though. Now especially is the time for us to put in some ungodly work in on the physical prep side to open up some affordances in the skill.\n\nGood training."
